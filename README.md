Here are points for the images:

ðŸ˜Ž ### Image 1: Employee Data Structure ðŸ˜Ž
- **Description:** This image displays a spreadsheet with columns for employee information such as Name, Employee ID, and First Name. The data appears to be partially filled, which might indicate the beginning of a data entry or data cleaning process.
- **Purpose:** To illustrate the initial structure of employee data before performing operations like data cleaning, sorting, or analysis.
- **Usage:** Useful for documentation related to setting up data for further processing, or as a baseline before applying data cleaning techniques.

ðŸ˜Ž ### Image 2: Complete Employee Dataset ðŸ˜Ž
- **Description:** This image showcases a more detailed spreadsheet containing employee data, including Employee Name, Employee ID, Department, Job Title, and other related fields. The data is well-organized and appears ready for analysis or reporting.
- **Purpose:** To demonstrate a complete and structured dataset that is ready for analysis or to serve as a reference for a well-maintained employee database.
- **Usage:** Ideal for user guides that focus on managing and utilizing employee data in a structured format for HR or administrative tasks.

ðŸ˜Ž ### Image 3: Model Accuracy Over Epochs ðŸ˜Ž
- **Description:** This image presents a graph showing the accuracy of a machine learning model over multiple epochs. The graph compares different accuracy metrics, including training and validation accuracy, across the training process.
- **Purpose:** To visualize the performance of a machine learning model, highlighting how accuracy improves over time as the model learns from the data.
- **Usage:** Suitable for documentation on machine learning, especially for explaining how model training is monitored and evaluated.
