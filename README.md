Here are points for the images:

### Image 1: Employee Data Structure
- **Description:** This image displays a spreadsheet with columns for employee information such as Name, Employee ID, and First Name. The data appears to be partially filled, which might indicate the beginning of a data entry or data cleaning process.
- **Purpose:** To illustrate the initial structure of employee data before performing operations like data cleaning, sorting, or analysis.
- **Usage:** Useful for documentation related to setting up data for further processing, or as a baseline before applying data cleaning techniques.

### Image 2: Complete Employee Dataset
- **Description:** This image showcases a more detailed spreadsheet containing employee data, including Employee Name, Employee ID, Department, Job Title, and other related fields. The data is well-organized and appears ready for analysis or reporting.
- **Purpose:** To demonstrate a complete and structured dataset that is ready for analysis or to serve as a reference for a well-maintained employee database.
- **Usage:** Ideal for user guides that focus on managing and utilizing employee data in a structured format for HR or administrative tasks.

### Image 3: Model Accuracy Over Epochs
- **Description:** This image presents a graph showing the accuracy of a machine learning model over multiple epochs. The graph compares different accuracy metrics, including training and validation accuracy, across the training process.
- **Purpose:** To visualize the performance of a machine learning model, highlighting how accuracy improves over time as the model learns from the data.
- **Usage:** Suitable for documentation on machine learning, especially for explaining how model training is monitored and evaluated.

### Image 4: Clean Data Spreadsheet
- **Description:** This image shows a spreadsheet where the data has been cleaned, organized, and possibly filtered for further analysis. The columns are clearly defined, and the data appears to be in a consistent format.
- **Purpose:** To illustrate the result of a data cleaning process, showcasing how raw data can be transformed into a clean and structured dataset.
- **Usage:** This image is useful in tutorials or documentation that teaches the importance of data cleaning before analysis, ensuring that the data is accurate and ready for use.

### Image 5: Data Cleaning Process Example
- **Description:** This image captures a spreadsheet undergoing a data cleaning process, with some fields potentially being corrected or filled in. The focus is on ensuring that the data is accurate and complete before further processing.
- **Purpose:** To demonstrate the steps involved in cleaning a dataset, emphasizing the importance of accuracy and consistency in data management.
- **Usage:** Ideal for instructional materials that guide users through the process of cleaning and preparing data for analysis.

### Image 6: Algorithm-Based Data Cleaning
- **Description:** This image shows a graph illustrating the process of cleaning data using an algorithm. The graph likely represents the improvement in data quality or model performance as the cleaning algorithm is applied over iterations.
- **Purpose:** To explain how algorithms can be used to clean and improve the quality of data, making it more suitable for analysis or machine learning.
- **Usage:** Useful for advanced guides or technical documentation that discusses automated data cleaning techniques and their impact on data quality and model performance.
